I have received a fake product. There are worms in the protein powder. It looks like a lot of flour (atta) has been mixed in it. Tastes awful as well. I found out that there is a cut on the packaging. Someone smartly removed the whey and added flour (atta) with worms and put the label back. The cut was made deep down the jar so that the user does not notice it until he has consumed a lot of the product. Very disappointed. My diabetic father consumed it and had to visit the doctor twice due to severe digestive problems after consuming this. I don't know who to turn to for help.,Reviewed in India on 12 July 2024,Flavour Name: Alphonso MangoSize: 2 Lbs,1

Verified on is saying it's legit product but i am facing following problem :-1. No seal is present. Yes it is one of the top brand but no seal. They give code on the box but what will i do with the box if lid can easily be slided and some additional things can be added. Am supposed to eat box or the protein inside it? Even a cady is better wraped then this whey.2. Its is some what soluble but some of the part stays on the top when mixed with milk ( cold as well as hot milk ) didn't expect that from a world renowned brand like on and takes too much time to mix.3. It's September 2023 but i got product with mfg date june 2022 although it's not expired yet but why am I getting 1 yr late product.I will never buy anything from on ever again.,Reviewed in India on 18 September 2023,Flavour Name: Extreme Milk ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,1

This may be associated with nausea, vomiting, sweating, or difficulties walking.The cardboard box in which the product was delivered was absolutely damaged but the product was genuine on ON's site. It seems to me that the box was cut and then again sealed back at the bottom. 60-80g of the sample is enough to induce swaying sensations.

Package quality of instruction sticker very bad for India manuf double chocolate flavour, looks compromised for cost when compared to imported. I hope similarly the inner content of protein powder is not compromised. Difficult to say now. Compromise is evident on brand sticker which in itself is a proof that there may be compromise on quality for more profits, as the local manuf and plus is still same price, then why consumers to buy localised product with quality compromise. We may buy some other brand which is imported as In india the food quality checks cannot be trusted and stringent as USA quality. Very bad, now we can't trust the system authentication as the system authenticated product itself looks compromised. Manufactured in India was hidden by a sticker for some reason I don't know why. So it seems Optimum Nutrition wants just profits on his brand and any Tom Dick Harry will manuf in india.",Reviewed in India on 31 January 2022,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,1

"Ordered on 5 Feb and received 8 Feb .I could not authenticate the product and the customer care did the authentication of the product on my behalf ! I wonder what different procedure they did and it got authentication right as there are only 2 ways to do so ..I opened the jar and it had no seal in the inside to protect it from moisture ..I was not able to mix it well with the water ..The smell is something weird and also taste is something like a cough syrup nothing like a double chocolate..The consistency is too wattery after mixing.The 10 Days Return / Replacement is a total scam with this product , so don't believe what the tab below the product says! As you try to get it replaced or try to return it, they can only connect you to the Amazon customer care who in turn will ask  to mail and connect with the manufacturer.Overall not worth and a disappointment.

I've ordered and received this product by March 2021... I've consumed only 30% of this protein powder. I didn't notice the expiry date.. I've been using since March and have been out of station for a while..  When I started using again it is August 2021 already and it tastes no good and found lumps...  Then when I check the expiry date it was expired July 2021 and manufactured date was July 2019.. How come the company supply products with such short expiry dates and expect consumers to consume it quick????  It is very expensive by the way....

I don't understand why they have 3 bar codes and only one was read by the machine.The whey pounder has some white color material in it.The packing and the seal was not proper and it is safe to say that I was damaged.Not sure if Amazon is selling original ON products.

It's just like every other home container.2. The hologram is sticker on above the cap. Not in proper place.3. Container's bottom is not matching the description that's stated on official website.I've performed these tests only on packaging and container and it looks fake that way. However, I haven't used any sort of protein before so I'm clueless how to test the actual product.N.B.: I'm only doubting the genuineness of this product by looking at the packaging because it doesn't match the one described on the official website.

Am a first time consumer of any kind of Whey Protein and based on the reviews have purchased this one.The delivery was smooth and had checked all the contents and verified the authenticity on the website through the code on the pack.I have taken vanilla ice cream flavor and have found it to be too sweet to my taste buds.,Reviewed in India on 21 April 2023,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 2 Lbs,3
"I got this flavor after reading a lot positive comments about it. Though it turned out to be a disappointment to me. It felt so bad that I thought of throwing it out.A few days, I decided to read the instruction in the jar and it said you need to mix it with 180-240ml water. That's where I was wrong. I was mixing it with 150-180ml water(perfect quantity for Double Rich Chocolate).Those who are disliking it's flavor can try this - 250ml water + 5-6 ice cubes. It will drastically reduce down the sweetness and make it far more tolerable.No issues with the whey quality but I'm never buying this flavor again!",Reviewed in India on 6 June 2022,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 2 Lbs,3

When I opened the lid, there was no seal pack at the top of the jar. Usualy even indian brands have the sealed air tight bottle opening.2. The moment I opened the Jar, a gush of stink entered  my nose. Although it lasted only Few seconds, but there it was.3. It does not dissplve easily. Even after shaking few times, few chunks of the protein remain undissolved.I never faced any of these problems in any of the indian brands. So I'm very very much disappointed.

"Vanilla ice cream flavour is the best tasting flavor in my opinion. With chilled milk it tastes just like vanilla milk shake. No additional sugar needed. But for those of you want low-sugar protein powder, this may not be for you.Seems to be of good quality. But recent studies on some of the whey protein brands including Optimum Nutrition suggest presence of aflatoxins and lead? It would be nice to have someone confirm if these problems have been resolved and if they are within safe levels.Been taking this protein powder on and off for a couple of years now. So far never experienced any side effects or bloating.It does come a bit costly but i guess its justified because its imported and is of pretty good quality.

"I WILL GIVE THE FULL REVIEW POINT BY POINT (with attached Photos). ENJOY AND KEEP READING, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.Just to clarify and to be honest, this is the first time I'm using a Whey protein, not just the brand but Whey protein itself. Though, I was very skeptical about the purchase after reading so many reviews about the product being fake, I still decided to order it.ABOUT THE JAR/TUB (AUTHENTICITY CHECK from the outside): There was a strong chocolate smell on the outside of the jar already. I checked the bottom of the jar and the tub looked normal. Mfd and Exp date had exactly 2 years gap. I did not find any tampering marks whatsoever.There was the ""ON Authentic seal"" on the neck band. I checked everything thoroughly before opening it. The QR code on the jar itself led me to product page of Optimum Nutrition website.The QR code on the importer sticker led me to Bright Commodities authenticity checking page. I scratched the Importer sticker for the hidden code and entered all the details and it said that the product is authentic.After opening the jar, I did find the seal attached on the lid.The jar was kind of half filled, not up to the brim. (Doubt 1)I also found the golden scoop with the branding on it and Made in USA written inside the scoop along with some other details.SMELL, CONSISTENCY AND TEXTURE OF THE POWDER: The power smelled nice and the texture was normal I think (First time user), not clumpy or anything.No stickiness at all, the powder did not stick to the inside of the jar. (Authenticity checking method found somewhere online)One thing that I noticed was that, the powder had some white particles in it. (Doubt 2)Now, to clear out my doubts I called 011-49594959 which was Glanbia Performance Nutrition. I followed the instructions given by the IVR and asked about my doubts. The customer executive was helpful enough and told that ""The product is 100% authentic. The jar is supposed to be filled half way and the white particles are 'Amino Acids'.""I was satisfied with all the authenticity checking and all.TASTE: Though it smelled really chocolaty, the taste was just okay. According to me, it had a medicinal taste to it.Consistency was okay, not thick at all, it might just be the amount of water I added. (1 full scoop in one glass of water)MIXABILITY: It mixed with the water fairly easily. Found 1 tiny lump, and by ""tiny"" I really mean tiny, most of the people won't even notice it probably. I noticed it because I was trying to find lumps intentionally. Now, keep in mind that I did not use a shaker, it was simply stirred with a spoon in a glass. I did not even stir vigorously. So, mixability is good I think.RATING: Now, talking about the rating, I gave it a 4* just because the taste was okay.",Reviewed in India on 21 March 2018,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,4

"So this was my 1st time ordering a protein supplement online and as per others i was also apprehensive about the genuineness. The seller was cloudtail so that was ok and i placed the order. Opened the packaging and carefully examined the box, showed no signs of tampering. The expiry date and batch number were printed on the bottom so that was a good sign. Product was made in Jan this year. Then i tried to scratch the authentication code but it was not coming off so i called the toll free number of glanbia. Gave them the batch number and got confirmation that its a genuine box. Then i realized that you can just remove the scratch sticker and see the number below it. Tracked it on authenticateon website and it was registered there so it was confirmed that its 100% genuine.Now about the taste, this is my 1st tasting ever and for a guy like me who isnt fussy about food/taste this is pretty decent. Not too sweet not too chocolatey.Mixability is great, no lumps or anything.Happy with the purchase.",Reviewed in India on 9 April 2021,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,4
So I watched a lot of YouTube videos regarding ON authenticity.My product did not have an importer tag also there was no blue expiry date on the bottom.So I called ON customer support and the agent mentioned below points-1. Glanbia (importer) now imports raw material from US and packaging is done in India. I guess the plant is in Himachal and established some 6 months back.2. There will be no importer tag in new ON boxes.3. Expiry date and batch number is now printed on back of the box in a white space with black ink and not on the bottom.4.No vaccum cover on the lid intead a pasted seal.5. Check authenticity by the TRU SEAL (which we all do).,Reviewed in India on 10 January 2022,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,4

"After having the chocolate flavour for quite a few months, this vanilla didn't disappoint either. One must be careful while buying ON products as it has been the best selling for almost 9 years now, it has the most duplication too specifically in our country. Some quick notices that one can do is firstly check for the distributors sticker along with its hologram. Bright Commodities is one among the 3 distributors of ON products in our country. Original bottle always has a shiny surface and the date of manufacture and expiry are either at the bottom or at the neck in bright blue colour(mostly). And the supplier is always  Glanbia,  US.  Talking about the inside, the scoop should have a ON mark engraved on it. But most importantly is the powder. Original protein powders are very fine in nature, almost like the talcum powder. On the contrary, duplicate powders are comparatively fat grains. I hope this makes your buying easy",Reviewed in India on 22 September 2017,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 2 Lbs,4
"Brand is famous and doesn't need any review however it is bit costly because of it's popularity.Take it but with safety.1. Never take more than necessary protein because excess protein can damage kidney. Yes we believe if we take extra, we will be stronger however it has side effects and shoud be consumed in safe limit.2. When you take protein you must drink minimum 3 litres of water. Again drinking excess water helps kidney to flush out excess urea and also excess unconsumed protein.3. When you don't excercise, don't take it. Many guys keep consuming it even after they don't go to gym or workout. Don't take it as a health nutrition.4. When you visit any gym, the gym trainer try to brainwash you to buy protein powder. Never listen to the gym guy because he gets commision to sell protein powder. If you really need, get one. Also don't buy the brand suggested by gym trainer. To get high commission they suggest you any other brand and they don't care about your health. They just care about their commision.Thanks for reading.

Rocky Road is good, but a bit too creamy, in my opinion. Maybe my taste buds are just used to vanilla, but the Rocky Road flavor always leaves an aftertaste in my mouth, which I don't like at all. If you're getting it, I suggest getting some other flavor.Vanilla, Chocolate and Cappuccino are all great flavors.The product itself is original, and came with the authentication sticker (Seller: Primarc Pecan Retail; They are the official importers in India for ON).

I recently purchased the Optimum Nutrition Mango Flavored Whey Protein from Amazon, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. First and foremost, the flavor is absolutely incredible with this reasonable price. As someone who has tried various protein powders in the past, I can confidently say that this mango flavor is a game-changer. It's not too sweet or artificial tasting, but rather has a refreshing and authentic mango taste that makes my post-workout shakes something to look forward to.Furthermore, Optimum Nutrition is a brand I trust when it comes to supplementing my fitness journey. Their products are always of high quality, and this whey protein is no exception.The ordering process through Amazon was seamless, with fast shipping ensuring that I received my product in perfect condition and right on time. The packaging was secure.Overall, I highly recommend the Optimum Nutrition Mango Flavored Whey Protein to anyone looking to enhance their workouts and support their fitness goals. With its delicious taste, effective results, and trusted brand reputation, it's a five-star product that deserves a spot in your supplement regimen!",Reviewed in India on 11 May 2024,Flavour Name: Alphonso MangoSize: 2 Lbs,5

"--------------------------------------UPDATE 11 March 2016---------------------------------------I keep an eye on my reviews but lately, I have seen this happening often . I get a few votes up for a review  and then quite strangely  a down vote the same day, that really has left me wondering if some people are deliberately down voting reviews. I don't understand how Amazon moderators are letting this off.---------------------------------------------I am compelled to write this review after seeing quite a few negative reviews calling it a fake or counterfeit which I find it quite misleading once again. I bought the 1lb pack to check the concerns raised that the packaging is mislabeled with a 23gram protein scoop. To all the concerned people, there is in fact 1lb Gold Standard refill pack with 24g protein per scoop. (Photos attached)
Optimum Nutrition (ON) 100% Whey Gold Standard - 2 lbs (Double Rich Chocolate)
is one of the best Whey proteins in the market today. Three things I liked about this product, the manufacturing is entirely done in the USA following strict US regulations, the grams of protein in each scoop and the taste.If you’re new to Protein Supplements, this is a quick overview of few major protein types that are sold in the market today.Most protein supplements that are in the market offer blends of different types of whey proteins. To make it easy, let me break it down for you. There are three types of fast digestive proteins, the cheapest is the Whey Concentrate typically a mass gainer with lots of carbs , then comes the more expensive Whey Isolate and then the most expensive Whey Hydro Isolate .Concentrate typically takes about 2-3 hours to digest, Isolates can be digested in your system within 2 hours, Hydro Isolates is purest form whey and can be taken even if you’re lactose intolerant - Hydro isolates can be digested within an hour and work best as Post Workout drinks. Basically, the price of your protein directly depends on the % of Whey Isolate or Whey Hydro Isolate present. There is also a slow digestive protein called Casein which is cheaper or almost the same as Whey Concentrate, treat this as a bedtime supplement as it takes about 6 hours to digest.What is OPTIMUM NUTRITION- 100% Whey Gold Standard ?ON 100% Whey Gold Standard is a multi-whey blend comprising isolates & concentrates as its main ingredients. It contains 24 grams of protein per serving, with a bit of fat, cholesterol, and lactose. Bear in mind, if you’re lactose intolerant, this is not for you unfortunately.Taste, Texture and MixabilityIt is not very sweet and mixes well with water and milk. I didn’t feel bloated and Double Chocolate flavour I’ve tried was good, and I will give8.5/10 for the taste9.5/10 for mixabilityTotal score 9/10When will I start seeing results?This is the bitter truth, Protein supplements would help you <20% to reach your fitness goals. Your everyday workout helps you about another 30% and the rest is your daily diet as to how you maintain yourself eating healthy. You’re not going to get fitter staying home and just having 3 protein smoothies a day.From somewhere I had once read, you don’t buy protein protein supplements till you are regular at the gym working out and eating healthy for at least 90 days. Once those two habits are accomplished, buy protein supplements, and you will see results.Are protein supplements necessary?This question is debatable but it all comes down to how much protein is in your everyday diet. If you’ve enough protein in your diet, no need obviously. From a personal perspective, I would avoid processed food like protein supplements any day, if I can consume enough protein through my diet (egg, milk, meat etc)Health Benefits/ IssuesIt is always advisable to take protein in their natural form (Milk, Egg, Meat, etc), but with a vegetarian diet that could be challenging. Rule of thumb with supplements is DO NOT go overboard - DO NOT take more than 2 scoops in 24 hours, but personally, if you’re not aiming for the Olympics, I suggest to start with 1 scoop a day so that you go easy on your body. In addition, you MUST drink a lot of water when taking protein supplements. From a lecture of Dr Tara Swart of MIT Sloan, your body requires 500ml of water for every 30lb (13.6 Kg) of your weight in a day to function normally.Smoothie recipe = 1 scoop (Chocolate) + 1 Avacado + Banana + 200ml Almond Milk + Ice Cubes in a Blender .PLEASE NOTE: Insufficient water intake can give you Stomach pain/ Abdominal Pain with protein supplements. NOT to be considered professional/medical advice. This review is based on personal experience. Protein supplements are to be considered with caution.",Reviewed in India on 7 March 2016,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,5

"Title: Great Taste and High-Quality Protein Supplement!Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐I recently purchased the Optimum Nutrition Brand Whey Protein in the delicious vanilla flavor, and I must say it has greatly exceeded my expectations! Here are some key points to consider:1. Taste: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐The vanilla flavor is absolutely phenomenal! It has a smooth and creamy texture with a hint of natural vanilla taste. It's not overly sweet, making it perfect for those who prefer a more subtle flavor. Mixing it with water or milk creates a tasty and enjoyable protein shake.2. Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Optimum Nutrition is known for producing high-quality supplements, and this protein powder is no exception. It contains a blend of whey protein isolates, which are fast-acting and easily digestible. With each serving, you get a whopping 24 grams of protein, ensuring that your muscles receive the necessary fuel for growth and recovery.3. Mixability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐One of the things I love about this whey protein is how effortlessly it mixes with liquid. With just a few shakes in a shaker bottle or a quick stir with a spoon, there are no clumps or chunks left behind. This saves time and ensures a smooth and consistent texture, making it a breeze to consume.4. Versatility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Aside from the traditional protein shake, this versatile powder can be used in various ways. I often add it to my morning oatmeal, smoothies, or even pancakes, enhancing their nutritional value while adding a delightful vanilla flavor. It's a great way to incorporate protein into different meals throughout the day.5. Value for Money: ⭐⭐⭐⭐While the Optimum Nutrition brand may be slightly pricier than some other options on the market, the quality and taste justify the cost. Additionally, the product comes in various sizes, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your needs and budget.Overall, the Optimum Nutrition Brand Whey Protein in the vanilla flavor is a superior product that delivers on both taste and quality. If you're looking for a delicious and effective protein supplement, I highly recommend giving this one a try!",Reviewed in India on 2 August 2023,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 2 Lbs,5
"I bought this limited edition Mango flavour purely as an experiment. And I am glad that it turned out much better than expected.The taste is similar to any standard artificially flavoured mango shake drink. This one is thicker and creamier when mixed compared to other ON WHEY products.It does take a little extra shaking, compared to others, else you end up with a lumpy drink. Over the years I’ve learned to include 2-3 ice cubes in the mix and shake upwards of at least 100 shakes to get a lump free smooth protein shake.Overall the taste and texture is great and consistent with ON products.",Reviewed in India on 12 May 2024,Flavour Name: Alphonso MangoSize: 2 Lbs,5

The actual price shown during the sale was Rs 2999/-. So after applyig 5% Coupon Discount and 300 Bank Discount.

Shake it well and enjoy it.Attention--- Drink plenty of water otherwise excessive consumption of protein may damage your Kidney.Seller --- must be either ""RK World Infocom..."" Or ""Touchstone...."", but the sellers could be changed in future... But plz make sure to always purchase this item from authorized sellers ONlY.. Because many fake copies are available in the market... So better to purchase from the authorized seller...Supplement Results--- You would be able to see the results but do remember, it's not a rocket science that having one scoop of Whey a day, will make u or give some sort of Bulky/Hulk look.

"I am beginner in lifting and  have just started few months back. I am myself a health professional and initially, i was confused regarding the use of protein supplements because of all the myths about health issues associated with it. I went through so many studies about whey and decided to start consuming it. Trust me... whey protein is one of the best and fast digesting protein available, and provides a fuel that your muscles need after workout. You dont have to worry about what people and celebrities say about it like the one with ayushman khurana or akshay kumar. There is no harm in taking whey protein unless you are supposed to take low protein because of health issues like chronic kidney disease... well , in that case you cant lift heavy weights too as it migh lead to rhabdomyolisis. Well that’s different case.. Dont confuse it with drinks like horlicks protein that has high amount of carbohydrates and synthetic stuffs. Also people who thinks that such proteins are mixed with steroid... trust me, i am a doctor...it doesnt make sense. You dont consume steroids like that... there is a cycle... and anabolic steroids its a different thing. second doubt was regarding the authenticity... because there are some companies that provides less amount of protein content and usually has smp or skimmed milke protein instead of whey! Well it is easy to check the authenticity of the powder... it is written right there on the label of the container!Lastly, as a beginner you can use it, when u want to build muscle you need protein for building it as proteins are the building blocks.Secondly, it is not a steroid or takes 3 years for digestion as ayushman ji had said. And regarding what akshay kumar has told about whey protein, he is himself doing ads for horlicks protein which itself has lots of added stuffs and carbohydrates.Lastly, ON is one of the leading protein supplement available in India. Just dont forget to check the authenticity. The process is simple",Reviewed in India on 9 August 2021,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 2 Lbs,5

Although I shifted to a new protein just so it was giving me cost benefit factor proved to be mistake since all these so called new better priced proteins start showing their true colour like once they start doing moderately well in Indian market. I feel one should never compromise on the quality of protein intake just for few hundred rupees because the damage a cheaper but lower quality protein does is irreparable. Be safe go with ON !!,Reviewed in India on 28 August 2023,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,5
