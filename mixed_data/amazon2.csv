I have received a fake product. There are worms in the protein powder. It looks like a lot of flour (atta) has been mixed in it. Tastes awful as well. I found out that there is a cut on the packaging. Someone smartly removed the whey and added flour (atta) with worms and put the label back. The cut was made deep down the jar so that the user does not notice it until he has consumed a lot of the product. Very disappointed. My diabetic father consumed it and had to visit the doctor twice due to severe digestive problems after consuming this. I don't know who to turn to for help.,Reviewed in India on 12 July 2024,Flavour Name: Alphonso MangoSize: 2 Lbs,1

Verified on is saying it's legit product but i am facing following problem :-1. No seal is present. Yes it is one of the top brand but no seal. They give code on the box but what will i do with the box if lid can easily be slided and some additional things can be added. Am supposed to eat box or the protein inside it? Even a cady is better wraped then this whey.2. Its is some what soluble but some of the part stays on the top when mixed with milk ( cold as well as hot milk ) didn't expect that from a world renowned brand like on and takes too much time to mix.3. It's September 2023 but i got product with mfg date june 2022 although it's not expired yet but why am I getting 1 yr late product.I will never buy anything from on ever again.,Reviewed in India on 18 September 2023,Flavour Name: Extreme Milk ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,1

This may be associated with nausea, vomiting, sweating, or difficulties walking.The cardboard box in which the product was delivered was absolutely damaged but the product was genuine on ON's site. It seems to me that the box was cut and then again sealed back at the bottom. 60-80g of the sample is enough to induce swaying sensations.

Package quality of instruction sticker very bad for India manuf double chocolate flavour, looks compromised for cost when compared to imported. I hope similarly the inner content of protein powder is not compromised. Difficult to say now. Compromise is evident on brand sticker which in itself is a proof that there may be compromise on quality for more profits, as the local manuf and plus is still same price, then why consumers to buy localised product with quality compromise. We may buy some other brand which is imported as In india the food quality checks cannot be trusted and stringent as USA quality. Very bad, now we can't trust the system authentication as the system authenticated product itself looks compromised. Manufactured in India was hidden by a sticker for some reason I don't know why. So it seems Optimum Nutrition wants just profits on his brand and any Tom Dick Harry will manuf in india.",Reviewed in India on 31 January 2022,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,1

"Ordered on 5 Feb and received 8 Feb .I could not authenticate the product and the customer care did the authentication of the product on my behalf ! I wonder what different procedure they did and it got authentication right as there are only 2 ways to do so ..I opened the jar and it had no seal in the inside to protect it from moisture ..I was not able to mix it well with the water ..The smell is something weird and also taste is something like a cough syrup nothing like a double chocolate..The consistency is too wattery after mixing.The 10 Days Return / Replacement is a total scam with this product , so don't believe what the tab below the product says! As you try to get it replaced or try to return it, they can only connect you to the Amazon customer care who in turn will ask  to mail and connect with the manufacturer.Overall not worth and a disappointment.

I've ordered and received this product by March 2021... I've consumed only 30% of this protein powder. I didn't notice the expiry date.. I've been using since March and have been out of station for a while..  When I started using again it is August 2021 already and it tastes no good and found lumps...  Then when I check the expiry date it was expired July 2021 and manufactured date was July 2019.. How come the company supply products with such short expiry dates and expect consumers to consume it quick????  It is very expensive by the way....

I don't understand why they have 3 bar codes and only one was read by the machine.The whey pounder has some white color material in it.The packing and the seal was not proper and it is safe to say that I was damaged.Not sure if Amazon is selling original ON products.

It's just like every other home container.2. The hologram is sticker on above the cap. Not in proper place.3. Container's bottom is not matching the description that's stated on official website.I've performed these tests only on packaging and container and it looks fake that way. However, I haven't used any sort of protein before so I'm clueless how to test the actual product.N.B.: I'm only doubting the genuineness of this product by looking at the packaging because it doesn't match the one described on the official website.

Am a first time consumer of any kind of Whey Protein and based on the reviews have purchased this one.The delivery was smooth and had checked all the contents and verified the authenticity on the website through the code on the pack.I have taken vanilla ice cream flavor and have found it to be too sweet to my taste buds.,Reviewed in India on 21 April 2023,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 2 Lbs,3
"I got this flavor after reading a lot positive comments about it. Though it turned out to be a disappointment to me. It felt so bad that I thought of throwing it out.A few days, I decided to read the instruction in the jar and it said you need to mix it with 180-240ml water. That's where I was wrong. I was mixing it with 150-180ml water(perfect quantity for Double Rich Chocolate).Those who are disliking it's flavor can try this - 250ml water + 5-6 ice cubes. It will drastically reduce down the sweetness and make it far more tolerable.No issues with the whey quality but I'm never buying this flavor again!",Reviewed in India on 6 June 2022,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 2 Lbs,3

When I opened the lid, there was no seal pack at the top of the jar. Usualy even indian brands have the sealed air tight bottle opening.2. The moment I opened the Jar, a gush of stink entered  my nose. Although it lasted only Few seconds, but there it was.3. It does not dissplve easily. Even after shaking few times, few chunks of the protein remain undissolved.I never faced any of these problems in any of the indian brands. So I'm very very much disappointed.

"Vanilla ice cream flavour is the best tasting flavor in my opinion. With chilled milk it tastes just like vanilla milk shake. No additional sugar needed. But for those of you want low-sugar protein powder, this may not be for you.Seems to be of good quality. But recent studies on some of the whey protein brands including Optimum Nutrition suggest presence of aflatoxins and lead? It would be nice to have someone confirm if these problems have been resolved and if they are within safe levels.Been taking this protein powder on and off for a couple of years now. So far never experienced any side effects or bloating.It does come a bit costly but i guess its justified because its imported and is of pretty good quality.

"I WILL GIVE THE FULL REVIEW POINT BY POINT (with attached Photos). ENJOY AND KEEP READING, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.Just to clarify and to be honest, this is the first time I'm using a Whey protein, not just the brand but Whey protein itself. Though, I was very skeptical about the purchase after reading so many reviews about the product being fake, I still decided to order it.ABOUT THE JAR/TUB (AUTHENTICITY CHECK from the outside): There was a strong chocolate smell on the outside of the jar already. I checked the bottom of the jar and the tub looked normal. Mfd and Exp date had exactly 2 years gap. I did not find any tampering marks whatsoever.There was the ""ON Authentic seal"" on the neck band. I checked everything thoroughly before opening it. The QR code on the jar itself led me to product page of Optimum Nutrition website.The QR code on the importer sticker led me to Bright Commodities authenticity checking page. I scratched the Importer sticker for the hidden code and entered all the details and it said that the product is authentic.After opening the jar, I did find the seal attached on the lid.The jar was kind of half filled, not up to the brim. (Doubt 1)I also found the golden scoop with the branding on it and Made in USA written inside the scoop along with some other details.SMELL, CONSISTENCY AND TEXTURE OF THE POWDER: The power smelled nice and the texture was normal I think (First time user), not clumpy or anything.No stickiness at all, the powder did not stick to the inside of the jar. (Authenticity checking method found somewhere online)One thing that I noticed was that, the powder had some white particles in it. (Doubt 2)Now, to clear out my doubts I called 011-49594959 which was Glanbia Performance Nutrition. I followed the instructions given by the IVR and asked about my doubts. The customer executive was helpful enough and told that ""The product is 100% authentic. The jar is supposed to be filled half way and the white particles are 'Amino Acids'.""I was satisfied with all the authenticity checking and all.TASTE: Though it smelled really chocolaty, the taste was just okay. According to me, it had a medicinal taste to it.Consistency was okay, not thick at all, it might just be the amount of water I added. (1 full scoop in one glass of water)MIXABILITY: It mixed with the water fairly easily. Found 1 tiny lump, and by ""tiny"" I really mean tiny, most of the people won't even notice it probably. I noticed it because I was trying to find lumps intentionally. Now, keep in mind that I did not use a shaker, it was simply stirred with a spoon in a glass. I did not even stir vigorously. So, mixability is good I think.RATING: Now, talking about the rating, I gave it a 4* just because the taste was okay.",Reviewed in India on 21 March 2018,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,4

"So this was my 1st time ordering a protein supplement online and as per others i was also apprehensive about the genuineness. The seller was cloudtail so that was ok and i placed the order. Opened the packaging and carefully examined the box, showed no signs of tampering. The expiry date and batch number were printed on the bottom so that was a good sign. Product was made in Jan this year. Then i tried to scratch the authentication code but it was not coming off so i called the toll free number of glanbia. Gave them the batch number and got confirmation that its a genuine box. Then i realized that you can just remove the scratch sticker and see the number below it. Tracked it on authenticateon website and it was registered there so it was confirmed that its 100% genuine.Now about the taste, this is my 1st tasting ever and for a guy like me who isnt fussy about food/taste this is pretty decent. Not too sweet not too chocolatey.Mixability is great, no lumps or anything.Happy with the purchase.",Reviewed in India on 9 April 2021,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,4
So I watched a lot of YouTube videos regarding ON authenticity.My product did not have an importer tag also there was no blue expiry date on the bottom.So I called ON customer support and the agent mentioned below points-1. Glanbia (importer) now imports raw material from US and packaging is done in India. I guess the plant is in Himachal and established some 6 months back.2. There will be no importer tag in new ON boxes.3. Expiry date and batch number is now printed on back of the box in a white space with black ink and not on the bottom.4.No vaccum cover on the lid intead a pasted seal.5. Check authenticity by the TRU SEAL (which we all do).,Reviewed in India on 10 January 2022,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,4

"After having the chocolate flavour for quite a few months, this vanilla didn't disappoint either. One must be careful while buying ON products as it has been the best selling for almost 9 years now, it has the most duplication too specifically in our country. Some quick notices that one can do is firstly check for the distributors sticker along with its hologram. Bright Commodities is one among the 3 distributors of ON products in our country. Original bottle always has a shiny surface and the date of manufacture and expiry are either at the bottom or at the neck in bright blue colour(mostly). And the supplier is always  Glanbia,  US.  Talking about the inside, the scoop should have a ON mark engraved on it. But most importantly is the powder. Original protein powders are very fine in nature, almost like the talcum powder. On the contrary, duplicate powders are comparatively fat grains. I hope this makes your buying easy",Reviewed in India on 22 September 2017,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 2 Lbs,4
"Brand is famous and doesn't need any review however it is bit costly because of it's popularity.Take it but with safety.1. Never take more than necessary protein because excess protein can damage kidney. Yes we believe if we take extra, we will be stronger however it has side effects and shoud be consumed in safe limit.2. When you take protein you must drink minimum 3 litres of water. Again drinking excess water helps kidney to flush out excess urea and also excess unconsumed protein.3. When you don't excercise, don't take it. Many guys keep consuming it even after they don't go to gym or workout. Don't take it as a health nutrition.4. When you visit any gym, the gym trainer try to brainwash you to buy protein powder. Never listen to the gym guy because he gets commision to sell protein powder. If you really need, get one. Also don't buy the brand suggested by gym trainer. To get high commission they suggest you any other brand and they don't care about your health. They just care about their commision.Thanks for reading.

Rocky Road is good, but a bit too creamy, in my opinion. Maybe my taste buds are just used to vanilla, but the Rocky Road flavor always leaves an aftertaste in my mouth, which I don't like at all. If you're getting it, I suggest getting some other flavor.Vanilla, Chocolate and Cappuccino are all great flavors.The product itself is original, and came with the authentication sticker (Seller: Primarc Pecan Retail; They are the official importers in India for ON).

I recently purchased the Optimum Nutrition Mango Flavored Whey Protein from Amazon, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. First and foremost, the flavor is absolutely incredible with this reasonable price. As someone who has tried various protein powders in the past, I can confidently say that this mango flavor is a game-changer. It's not too sweet or artificial tasting, but rather has a refreshing and authentic mango taste that makes my post-workout shakes something to look forward to.Furthermore, Optimum Nutrition is a brand I trust when it comes to supplementing my fitness journey. Their products are always of high quality, and this whey protein is no exception.The ordering process through Amazon was seamless, with fast shipping ensuring that I received my product in perfect condition and right on time. The packaging was secure.Overall, I highly recommend the Optimum Nutrition Mango Flavored Whey Protein to anyone looking to enhance their workouts and support their fitness goals. With its delicious taste, effective results, and trusted brand reputation, it's a five-star product that deserves a spot in your supplement regimen!",Reviewed in India on 11 May 2024,Flavour Name: Alphonso MangoSize: 2 Lbs,5

"--------------------------------------UPDATE 11 March 2016---------------------------------------I keep an eye on my reviews but lately, I have seen this happening often . I get a few votes up for a review  and then quite strangely  a down vote the same day, that really has left me wondering if some people are deliberately down voting reviews. I don't understand how Amazon moderators are letting this off.---------------------------------------------I am compelled to write this review after seeing quite a few negative reviews calling it a fake or counterfeit which I find it quite misleading once again. I bought the 1lb pack to check the concerns raised that the packaging is mislabeled with a 23gram protein scoop. To all the concerned people, there is in fact 1lb Gold Standard refill pack with 24g protein per scoop. (Photos attached)
Optimum Nutrition (ON) 100% Whey Gold Standard - 2 lbs (Double Rich Chocolate)
is one of the best Whey proteins in the market today. Three things I liked about this product, the manufacturing is entirely done in the USA following strict US regulations, the grams of protein in each scoop and the taste.If you’re new to Protein Supplements, this is a quick overview of few major protein types that are sold in the market today.Most protein supplements that are in the market offer blends of different types of whey proteins. To make it easy, let me break it down for you. There are three types of fast digestive proteins, the cheapest is the Whey Concentrate typically a mass gainer with lots of carbs , then comes the more expensive Whey Isolate and then the most expensive Whey Hydro Isolate .Concentrate typically takes about 2-3 hours to digest, Isolates can be digested in your system within 2 hours, Hydro Isolates is purest form whey and can be taken even if you’re lactose intolerant - Hydro isolates can be digested within an hour and work best as Post Workout drinks. Basically, the price of your protein directly depends on the % of Whey Isolate or Whey Hydro Isolate present. There is also a slow digestive protein called Casein which is cheaper or almost the same as Whey Concentrate, treat this as a bedtime supplement as it takes about 6 hours to digest.What is OPTIMUM NUTRITION- 100% Whey Gold Standard ?ON 100% Whey Gold Standard is a multi-whey blend comprising isolates & concentrates as its main ingredients. It contains 24 grams of protein per serving, with a bit of fat, cholesterol, and lactose. Bear in mind, if you’re lactose intolerant, this is not for you unfortunately.Taste, Texture and MixabilityIt is not very sweet and mixes well with water and milk. I didn’t feel bloated and Double Chocolate flavour I’ve tried was good, and I will give8.5/10 for the taste9.5/10 for mixabilityTotal score 9/10When will I start seeing results?This is the bitter truth, Protein supplements would help you <20% to reach your fitness goals. Your everyday workout helps you about another 30% and the rest is your daily diet as to how you maintain yourself eating healthy. You’re not going to get fitter staying home and just having 3 protein smoothies a day.From somewhere I had once read, you don’t buy protein protein supplements till you are regular at the gym working out and eating healthy for at least 90 days. Once those two habits are accomplished, buy protein supplements, and you will see results.Are protein supplements necessary?This question is debatable but it all comes down to how much protein is in your everyday diet. If you’ve enough protein in your diet, no need obviously. From a personal perspective, I would avoid processed food like protein supplements any day, if I can consume enough protein through my diet (egg, milk, meat etc)Health Benefits/ IssuesIt is always advisable to take protein in their natural form (Milk, Egg, Meat, etc), but with a vegetarian diet that could be challenging. Rule of thumb with supplements is DO NOT go overboard - DO NOT take more than 2 scoops in 24 hours, but personally, if you’re not aiming for the Olympics, I suggest to start with 1 scoop a day so that you go easy on your body. In addition, you MUST drink a lot of water when taking protein supplements. From a lecture of Dr Tara Swart of MIT Sloan, your body requires 500ml of water for every 30lb (13.6 Kg) of your weight in a day to function normally.Smoothie recipe = 1 scoop (Chocolate) + 1 Avacado + Banana + 200ml Almond Milk + Ice Cubes in a Blender .PLEASE NOTE: Insufficient water intake can give you Stomach pain/ Abdominal Pain with protein supplements. NOT to be considered professional/medical advice. This review is based on personal experience. Protein supplements are to be considered with caution.",Reviewed in India on 7 March 2016,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs,5

"Title: Great Taste and High-Quality Protein Supplement!Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐I recently purchased the Optimum Nutrition Brand Whey Protein in the delicious vanilla flavor, and I must say it has greatly exceeded my expectations! Here are some key points to consider:1. Taste: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐The vanilla flavor is absolutely phenomenal! It has a smooth and creamy texture with a hint of natural vanilla taste. It's not overly sweet, making it perfect for those who prefer a more subtle flavor. Mixing it with water or milk creates a tasty and enjoyable protein shake.2. Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Optimum Nutrition is known for producing high-quality supplements, and this protein powder is no exception. It contains a blend of whey protein isolates, which are fast-acting and easily digestible. With each serving, you get a whopping 24 grams of protein, ensuring that your muscles receive the necessary fuel for growth and recovery.3. Mixability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐One of the things I love about this whey protein is how effortlessly it mixes with liquid. With just a few shakes in a shaker bottle or a quick stir with a spoon, there are no clumps or chunks left behind. This saves time and ensures a smooth and consistent texture, making it a breeze to consume.4. Versatility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Aside from the traditional protein shake, this versatile powder can be used in various ways. I often add it to my morning oatmeal, smoothies, or even pancakes, enhancing their nutritional value while adding a delightful vanilla flavor. It's a great way to incorporate protein into different meals throughout the day.5. Value for Money: ⭐⭐⭐⭐While the Optimum Nutrition brand may be slightly pricier than some other options on the market, the quality and taste justify the cost. Additionally, the product comes in various sizes, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your needs and budget.Overall, the Optimum Nutrition Brand Whey Protein in the vanilla flavor is a superior product that delivers on both taste and quality. If you're looking for a delicious and effective protein supplement, I highly recommend giving this one a try!",Reviewed in India on 2 August 2023,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 2 Lbs,5
"I bought this limited edition Mango flavour purely as an experiment. And I am glad that it turned out much better than expected.The taste is similar to any standard artificially flavoured mango shake drink. This one is thicker and creamier when mixed compared to other ON WHEY products.It does take a little extra shaking, compared to others, else you end up with a lumpy drink. Over the years I’ve learned to include 2-3 ice cubes in the mix and shake upwards of at least 100 shakes to get a lump free smooth protein shake.Overall the taste and texture is great and consistent with ON products.",Reviewed in India on 12 May 2024,Flavour Name: Alphonso MangoSize: 2 Lbs,5

The actual price shown during the sale was Rs 2999/-. So after applyig 5% Coupon Discount and 300 Bank Discount.

Shake it well and enjoy it.Attention--- Drink plenty of water otherwise excessive consumption of protein may damage your Kidney.Seller --- must be either ""RK World Infocom..."" Or ""Touchstone...."", but the sellers could be changed in future... But plz make sure to always purchase this item from authorized sellers ONlY.. Because many fake copies are available in the market... So better to purchase from the authorized seller...Supplement Results--- You would be able to see the results but do remember, it's not a rocket science that having one scoop of Whey a day, will make u or give some sort of Bulky/Hulk look.

"I am beginner in lifting and  have just started few months back. I am myself a health professional and initially, i was confused regarding the use of protein supplements because of all the myths about health issues associated with it. I went through so many studies about whey and decided to start consuming it. Trust me... whey protein is one of the best and fast digesting protein available, and provides a fuel that your muscles need after workout. You dont have to worry about what people and celebrities say about it like the one with ayushman khurana or akshay kumar. There is no harm in taking whey protein unless you are supposed to take low protein because of health issues like chronic kidney disease... well , in that case you cant lift heavy weights too as it migh lead to rhabdomyolisis. Well that’s different case.. Dont confuse it with drinks like horlicks protein that has high amount of carbohydrates and synthetic stuffs. Also people who thinks that such proteins are mixed with steroid... trust me, i am a doctor...it doesnt make sense. You dont consume steroids like that... there is a cycle... and anabolic steroids its a different thing. second doubt was regarding the authenticity... because there are some companies that provides less amount of protein content and usually has smp or skimmed milke protein instead of whey! Well it is easy to check the authenticity of the powder... it is written right there on the label of the container!Lastly, as a beginner you can use it, when u want to build muscle you need protein for building it as proteins are the building blocks.Secondly, it is not a steroid or takes 3 years for digestion as ayushman ji had said. And regarding what akshay kumar has told about whey protein, he is himself doing ads for horlicks protein which itself has lots of added stuffs and carbohydrates.Lastly, ON is one of the leading protein supplement available in India. Just dont forget to check the authenticity. The process is simple",Reviewed in India on 9 August 2021,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 2 Lbs,5

Although I shifted to a new protein just so it was giving me cost benefit factor proved to be mistake since all these so called new better priced proteins start showing their true colour like once they start doing moderately well in Indian market.

"Don’t ever buy ON products from Amazon. They are blended, often with harmful chemicals, which unfortunately I had to eventually find out. I ordered the cookies and cream flavor and what I got wasn’t cookies and cream. It was something very different. I have been using C&C for over 5 years and know the taste and look. I immediately tried to return it but was bogged down by plethora of red tape. Interestingly, every check indicated that the product was genuine( including the verification code) but after tasting it ( i had my doubts even before that just by the look- c&c has a white-ish color, my protein had a light brick-is color), it was apparent that it wasn’t genuine. Since the code returned to be genuine, I was unable to return this and get a refund. Against my best judgment ( and didn’t want to waste 7k) I started using this and after a week, i was feeling pain in my liver 30 mins after I took it. It was very apparent that it was due to the blended whey. I threw out the entire 5lb container. So if you value your life, don’t order from Amazon, order direct from glanbia or HealthKart as I have been, ever since and never had any issue.",Reviewed in India on 21 March 2022,Flavour Name: Cookies & CreamSize: 5 Lbs,1

"I cannot comment definitively on the authenticity of the product yet (like how many people in the reviews are calling it fake) because it's just been a few days. But a thing of particular note is that I am unable to verify the authenticity using either of the two methods claimed by the brand.I scratched and sent the code by SMS on the number given (multiple times, using multiple different numbers) but did not receive a single text back. I also tried verifying online on the website given but never received the OTP to login. I don't know what's going on there but I certainly expected much better experience with a brand like ON. Even after a week, the product remains unverified.Another major concern is with the original packaging (not the amazon box, but ON's own packaging).First of all, there is no seal (after opening the lid) which is a standard industry practice to have. Why they have made without it, only they know (or is there a possibility that I received a counterfeit product?)Secondly, the outer seal (the thin plastic film ring on the lid itself) when taken apart, spilled a huge amount of product outside. A lot of whey protein powder must have been accumulated in between due to the lack of inner seal and during transportation. As you can see in the picture, this amount is pretty significant and also ruins your experience. Am I supposed to clean this up every time I open a jar of whey?As of flavour and mixability, they're both good. Nothing to complain about.Results? Too early to tell.Seriously considering giving ON a hard pass because of the issues mentioned earlier in the review. There are cheaper and better options available like Ultimate Nutrition Prostar.

I don't expect to get bloating but if you feel a general degree of flatulence, then you too could potentially be lactose intolerant, in which case it's best to either use pure isolate (golden coloured label on container from ON) or use GNC Amp - which i found i could digest well.While it's still not the worst choice, it's not ideal if you are lactose intolerant.I found MyProtein & MuscleBlaze to not be good enough - isolate or vegan (pea protein, soy protein).",Reviewed in India on 27 August 2022,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 8.8 Lbs,4
"ON Gold is supposed to be one of the best whey product on the market. I may be so. I used myprotein for over a year, but wanted to try out something different. This discount deal came by. The protein may be doing what it is supposed to do. No bloating or any adverse reaction in the past month that I started this ON tub. The milkshake is thicker than I am used to. This is vanilla flavor. But there is definite artificial taste to it, slight bitterness. I don't think I will order vanilla again after I finish this 4kg tub.",Reviewed in India on 8 February 2023,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 8.8 Lbs,4
"ON (Optimum Nutrition) Gold Standard Whey Protein Isolate is undoubtedly by far the best supplement going around. Well, considering the competitive Indian market the price is a lil on the higher side though. Having said that, if u can afford it, just go for it.Have been using the product for roughly 2 years now. Mostly bought from Amazon and I make it a point to select seller as Cloudtail India. I proudly claim, have never been disappointed. Always received original and authentic product and have suggested at least dozen of guys to buy it from Amazon.Like every other time I was excited to open my box of goodies. I was taken aback to see a duplicate product. Surprisingly enough the seller didn't even put enough effort to resemble it to the original packing. Guess what it doesn't even have the manufacturer, expiry date and batch number stamp (Refer picture to see how it looks like- stampis blue in color on the original one). I mean, come on the D-Kompany don't be so obvious.  The outside cover itself had such massive difference that didn't even have to open the packing.Please refer to the snaps attached.Left - OriginalRight - DuplicateThe million dollar question is how to identify, rather differentiate? Well, there are dozens of ways to recognize. Always look for the importer sticker (BRIGHT COMMODITIES) with QR code, fssai code, address and other stuff - see picture. The blue stamp, as aforementioned. See the pics and m sure it's a no brainer to come up with numerous differences.Hope it helps guys and wish everyone get their hands on an original one.",Reviewed in India on 12 June 2019,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 8.8 Lbs,4

Great product for protein supplement. Bit costly as it is imported from US but worth every penny provided a proper diet plan and exercise is followed with its consumption. Try i h e r b as they ship all health supplements made in US including Optimum nutrition brand directly. So you can save more as a benefit of buying directly. The shipping cost by UPS is roughly Rs. 900 and you get the product delivered to your home within a week! Still the overall price is cheaper than buying from an importer from India.

"There are many fake supplements coming these days we have to be alert about all the supplements is there any body in India or Mumbai which can decide weather the supplement is pure and original like a governor body for the supplements in India weather its a Imported or Indian Brand.Unfortunately up to date, there is no regulatory or watchdog body which is in charge of regulating and managing the import, manufacture or distribution of supplements. They currently come under the Prevention of Food Adulterant n Act 1958 (PFA Act) which as you can see is an archaic act. The result has been a slew of unregulated, adulterated & fake supplements making their way into the Indian market over the past decade.Luckily in the offing and hopefully to come into effect next year is the all-new FSSA (Food Standards & Safety Act), currently FSSB Food Standards & safety Bill which was passed in Parliament. This Act finally recognizes ""DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS"" as a separate entity and is modeled on the lines of the DSHEA, CODEX and the EU Food Laws. Needless to say that it is a state-of-the-art ACT.",Reviewed in India on 13 March 2021,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 8.8 Lbs,4
"ON Gold Standard is priced slightly higher than other brands like Ultimate Nutrition, Muscleblaze etc for the almost the same protein content per serving.This is the best protein when it comes to taste, mixability quality and digestibility. I highly recommend that you try the Mocha Capuccino flavor. Also highly recommended is that you mix it with another base liquid and not just water. I use 200-250 ml milk and 500-550 ml water. Please do not use only water otherwise it will taste super weird. You can also add flavoring of your own like Unflavored yoghurt, peanut butter, Vanilla ice cream etc. Make sure you add something else with water and the additive doesn't overwhelm the capuccino's flavor. Most of the weird taste comments are because of this reason only.As for the product, it is genuine. Bright commodities is an authorized importer of ON Whey Protein. The QR code checks out. You're getting a much better deal on Amazon compared to Healthkart or PayTM etc and you get faster delivery. I got it in 24 hours.I used to have Ultimate Nutrition before. But this beats it in every department especially digestibility. UN was hard to digest, personally for me. I would have to go Number 2 , everytime I had a serving. No such complaints with ON.Tl;dr Great protein powder, highly recommended.",Reviewed in India on 16 May 2018,Flavour Name: Mocha CappuchinoSize: 5 Lbs,5

"On Gold Standard 100% Whey protein is continuously winning awards from 11 years as the best isolate whey protein and i'm using it from 2 years the best ever whey protein with the best results you get. Well talking about the flavour that it has More than 18 different flavours than any other whey protein manufacturer has.For better results take it immediately after your workout and try to take minimum 2 to 3 scoops daily as i take 1 scoop one hour later  in morning after breakfast mixed with yoghurt and 1.5 scoop after workout in evening but keep in mind don't eat for 1 hour after consuming it let it get digested and then take your meals otherwise you are wasting your whey protein.Tips to find the product is genuine or not1. Lot Number : Every optimum nutrition product has a lot number which signifies that it belongs to the original ON product batch. This number can be found on the bottom of the jar.2. MFG and Expiry Date : Always check manufacturing date and expiry date. An expired product is of no use because it can give you serious side effects.3. Product Label : ON Gold Standard 100% Whey’s product label is printed with dark and vibrant colors with a shiny and smooth finish. You should check the label thoroughly, it should not look flimsy. It also lists 24g WPI, 5.5g BCAAs and 4g Glutamine. You should check that this info is correct on your label.4. Grammatical Errors : There is no room for grammatical errors on Optimum Nutrition’s product label. If you find any errors on the product label then it is fake.5. Check Seal : The container should be sealed properly from outside especially the lid is properly sealed if ON Gold 100 Whey is genuine. The seal is shiny and also the lead. Do not accept if there is no seal.6. Check Manufacturer’s Address : All ON products are mostly manufactured in the USA, so your Whey protein container should have the USA manufactures address. Check the back of the container.7. Scan The Bar Code : On the jar you will find a QR code and a bar code. Just scan these codes with your smartphone by using a QR code scanning app. It will show you product details. If the details come to be about ON Gold Standard 100% Whey then its genuine otherwise fake.#Flavours are rated above.🤤Extereme milk chocolate  10/10🍫Double rich chocolate.  9/10🍫Chocolate mint  8/10🍫Vanila ice cream.  8/10🍨Rocky road.  7/10😤Mocha cappuccino.  10/10☕️Birthday cake. 7/10🎂Although my favourite is mocha cappuccino and extreme milk chocolate but mostly i take mocha cappuccino Because it taste little bit like coffee and i take it in cold low fat milk that's why it taste like cold coffee.So guys i think you will find this helpful.😘This time the packaging was worse the jar was damaged but it is genuine.

"First of all. This is my first ON product purchase. I've purchased whey only once before and in this limited contrast I can say with certainty that the flavor is exactly like what you smell in a vial of vanilla flavor liquid. The intensity is not as much obviously which is a good thing. The best part of this specific flavor is to experiment with fruits, peanut butter and nuts.I received the tub which is exactly what I was hoping for. The scoop was not buried as the whey came in a soft-plastic bag within the tub and the scoop was just tagged alongside out of the soft-plastic in the tub. This is quite appreciative as it prevents wastage and is easy to scoop out of given the diameter of the cover.Honestly speaking, it is a bit expensive and not everybody is going to go for this as their first whey purchase, but the more experienced athletes this is a no-brainer if you have a knack to experiment in the kitchen.For the effects and potent review, I'm pretty sure the ON name is enough and I'm quite confident it won't disappoint if not exceed expectations.",Reviewed in India on 3 March 2022,Flavour Name: Vanilla Ice CreamSize: 8.8 Lbs,5
"I have been using Optimum Nutrition (ON) whey from more than an year now. It is really effective and must have protein for gym freaks who trains like beast in gym. It's a very important post workout supplement which acts as fast digestion and post workout recovery.I would like to mention, it's not that you had this and you'll see result, you have to workout, have proper diet to see results, but this gives you protein and other nutrition which helps in recovery and building muscles.I have tried Double Rich Chocolate, Coffee, Rocky Road and Mocha Cappuccino.Taste wise I personally liked Mocha Cappuccino and coffee as I am coffee lover, Double Rich Chocolate is also very good, less sweet as compared to others which is a plus point, Rocky Road tastes like bit of almonds.All four I have tried mixes well with water, I haven't tried with milk so cannot comment on it.I have been ordering from Primac Pecan Retail who is an authorized importer of ON here in India and I have never been dissatisfied, be it genuineity, delivery.

This is my repeat purchase of ON but first time for cream and cookies it is a welcome change. when u drink it has a very mild after taste because of the artificial sweetners which is normal.

"Double Chocolate Flavour used to taste amazing even with just water, now it tastes like some medicine. I feel like since they have started manufacturing this in India they have heavily downgraded the quality along with changing the packaging. All the recent good reviews are probably by people who received the old stock with the old packaging which was manufactured in the USA.I verified the 6 digit code on their website and it is apparently a genuine product. So only conclusion being that they are making this crap of a whey protein intentionally. Companies seriously should not take the Indian Market for granted and do away by selling trash product to the Indian buyers.

Now the bad part comes, the artifical flavour and sweetners that leaves a lingering supersweet taste for hours in your mouth and throat, which makes it harmful for prolonged and excessive use. I wonder why such a big and famous brand never provided unflavoured, unsweetened option for people who don't want these things inside their body.

"This was my first time ever with ON Protein Powder products. I have in the past tried its BCAA and Opti-Men series of multi vitamins and was very satisfied. But, when it comes to Protein powder supplements, I have stuck to Isopure for the past almost 13 years. I checked this product online and tried it. Here is my review:Likes# Pricing is much better. During good days, you can get it for about 1300 bucks for the 1lb packet# Protein percentage is very good. Almost 80% of the product mass.# Protein comes from Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) and not Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC). WPI is an ultra refined form of Whey Protein and contains far less carbohydrates and cholesterol. I consume only WPI# Added BCAA and Glutamine. This part was very attractive just like Isopure. I strongly recommend people to research the effects of BCAA and Glutamine and why they are important as supplements in your routine# The parent company is Glanbia. This is the same company that makes Isopure series of protein supplements. Their products can be trusted blindlyDislikes:# Even though it says Double Chocolate, the taste was not quite evident even after blending a scoopful in 200 mls of water# I once tried it in warm milk, trust me the experience was not good. The product almost curdled and formed cottage cheese (Paneer) like lumps and they did not taste good. I would have appreciated if they stated somewhere, that consuming it with warm milk/water is not advisableI think once this pouch is finished, I am going to switch back to Isopure protein products.",Reviewed in India on 7 August 2018,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 1 Lbs,4

"Dated feb15,2021 -I have got product mfd in 2019 n expiry date till 9/2021, it is within expiry date however for such health products like protein powder should be given of within last six months manufactured.  Like if it is after last 2020 July or August manufactured then that will be good for health. I was disappointed. Company can check a latest load n send that also.

I will suggest people to check as even gold std is best brand if they r not giving good service with good mind set to serve the society then don't buy it.",Reviewed in India on 15 February 2021,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 1 Lbs,4

"As a girl I'll say go for it. For guys it's good and if you want to bulk up you should maybe look for additional supplent. I used the vanilla flavour. It's light, easy to digest and fantastic flavour. You can add fruits to enhance the flavour and to make a nice smoothie too... The product is genuine. I can feel the difference after working out for a month without it and then just 1 week on it... muscles repair and their endurance increases thus helping you workout more and lose more fat... keeps appetite in control...

"I received the product 2 days before the delivery date(yup its true). I'm using this product for the first time.The protein powder was just like any other protein powder. Its pre flavoured (i ordered chocolate). I usually take it in the morning, immediately after work out. The taste is ok. You can actually add it to coffee or tea. One thing you have to be careful is not to add boiling water directly to the powder. That makes the powder to coagulate and form clumps. I transferred the entire packet in to an air tight container. So there is no problem with storage either for me.",Reviewed in India on 11 December 2016,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 1 Lbs,4

"So here I am, a Gymfreak(In my mind) and a regular guy(on the outside), I feel obliged to write this review as, I hope someone would have done that before me so that I would have been spared of all the things that I went through.One of the best flavour after French Vanilla Creme(I have a thing for vanilla flavour, I have tried 8 of 14 flavours)CHECKLIST FOR FIRST TIMERS1.AUTHENTICITY Check for all the genuinity parameters of the product( you can find them on the website of ON), plus the importers' hologram sticker i.e either BRIGHT or NEULIFE and it's really important If you don't find it simply return it, don't even try to open it.2. FLAVOURS Its subjective when it comes to taste. It's an absolute plethora when it comes to flavours, the rule of thumb would be to go with the flavour of icecream you like. I like vanilla so my order of choice is french vanilla creme>Vanilla Ice Cream>cookie & cream> Extreme milk chocolate>Double rich chocolate>Chocolate Malt.I'm not advocating for these flavours but they have worked for me and it's possible that it won't for someone else. Strawberry and Rocky Road were one of the biggest mistakes.3. QUANTITY Don't just jump in and buy a big tub just because it was on sale, first try the small pack of that flavour once you are satisfied only then get the bigger pack. Some people might be thinking that why am I stressing so much about flavour, Its one of the tastiest things one gets to have after a long workout and if it doesn't taste good what good is life, I once stopped going to gym just so that I don't have to go through the torcher of drinking it daily( I'm serious).4. CONSUMPTION Don't binge on it just because it tastes good, stick to the body needs and the label in conformity with a good diet and exercise.

"Gold standard was my first whey protein supplement and I ordered it on the basis of a friend's recommendation. I'm pleasantly surprised to see the results. As a supplement, ON Gold Standard delivers good results as is visible in my case. I've been working since 3 months now, and spend close to 2 hours in the gym everyday. For the 1st 1.5 months, I could hardly see any muscle definition or increase, nor could I see any visible progress in my strength; my lifts were stagnant and it was certainly demotivating. Come 1.5 months, I ordered the 2lb version and scooped up the entire thing in the matter of 18 days. I've ordered the 1lb pouch again after that. I'm happy to share that I've noticed and been complimented by friends and family members on gaining some muscle; it feels good after all the hard work. Plus, I've also seen a progressive increase in my overall strength and recovery time. Always order from Cloudtail, they are Amazon's most trusted seller and a part of Amazon just like WSR for Flipkart. My only gripe is that, I've felt a taste difference in the 1lb and 2lb pack with the 2lb pack being more sweet and more difficult to mix. Coming from the food industry, I frankly do not understand how the taste profile varies unless the manufacturer specifically uses different ingredients for for different SKUs. It is really sad if what I'm theorizing is true. Full marks for benefits though.",Reviewed in India on 19 May 2017,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 1 Lbs,5

"Original sealed packing for this orderPros:ON brandGood mixability, however, need to blend in mixeie or blenderHave tried various whey protein, so this is a good original powder.Cons:Too sweet. Wrote mail to company, they say sucralose is less than 2% of weight. But still too sweet.Sucralose is a problem with some people as it can cause rashes and itches.Packing is just okay. Need to transfer to air tight container.Conclusion:Good for your first whey.Overall, go for unflavoured concentrate or isolate. Add stevia liquid and some cocoa powder to tase.Do the maths.Unflavoured whey isloalate is Rs 2400 - Rs 300 per kg.Cocoa is Rs 200 - 400 per box.Stevia is Rs 150 for 20 ml. One drop is enough.So that combinations is better than this product.Also, always blend some fat source such as MCT oil, Almond oil, Coconut oil or milk cream with whey protein.This will spike the insulin less.In the end, follow a low-carb diet, have good proteins such as egg and whey and live a healthy life.For more on low-carb lifestyle, check Dlife forums.",Reviewed in India on 21 May 2017,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 1 Lbs,5

"My ON usage Reality :-In 2017 i started GYM with my friend , we both used to WORKOUT for 1 & a half hours DAILY but SHOCKINGLY even after 2 months , NO results were coming out. Then OUR TRAINER suggested us to include DIET SUPPLEMENTS( of any company ) as they are 'necessary for Overall built & repair of MUSCLES'.Then i SEARCHED internet & asked my friends regarding 'WHICH SUPPLEMENT to TAKE' ! Even my Father used to ask his friends about it.Soon we came to know that OPTIMUM NUTRITION is the BEST supplement in the MARKET & one can go with it without having a 2nd thought.So within no TIME i ordered ' ON  Gold Standard Whey Protein Chocolate Flavour'  thru amazon & started consuming it with Milk.Me & my friend was shockingly happy on seeing the RESULTS.

"Well as we all know that Optimum Nutrition is one of the best brand when it comes to Whey Protein. The products are imported from USA so that's why they are a bit expensive. But they are worth every rupee you pay. It's a value for money product. I ordered the Chocolate flavour, 1lb (454g) Packet for ₹999. The taste of the product is very good. The fragrance is also good. As far as results are concerned that truly depends on how much you work out and how well is your diet.",Reviewed in India on 4 November 2019,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 1 Lbs,5

"One of the best whey proteins i have used so far, optimum nutrition is one of the best brands when it comes to fitness supplements. I purchased it from seller primarc pecan retail who is one of the three official importers of ON products in India.Coming to the product, the flavor was nice, not so sweet which was very good when compared to other brands. Mixability was superb, there's no lumps while mixing and while coming to the effectiveness, it's too good when you have a proper diet and workout plan going hand in hand.

"This is my 3rd order of same product and pack. ON is the best nutrition brand available in India. This is bit costlier than few other whey protein options available online but I found it to be most safe  and effective as per my own research. I tried few other brands like British nutrition, Muscle blaze etc. I found ON whey being least sweet and most effective for muscle rejuvination.. it tastes bit bland because of very low sugar. But for me health benefit is of supreme importance.Receive free and quick delivery with prime membership. Also the price on Amazon is cheaper than what I get at my local shop.",Reviewed in India on 12 November 2017,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 1 Lbs,5

"For the people who consumed 2-3 whey protein brands , they know that the contribution of whey protein is limited to muscle building. It's like a refreshment for tired muscle after workout. So digestion of the protein I believe is important and this one stands above muscle blaze and other cheaper indian brands. Taste is great. Double chocolate . Price could be lower .

"This protein powder is way ahead of others. No doubt Optimum is a known brand. Some of my friends suggested me to try AMWAY Plant protein. However, after having tried both the brands, I personally find Optimum a better one. For a simple test, i tried mixing Amway powder and optimum creatin in plain water. The Amway powder forms lump and lacks taste. It was very difficult for me to drink it. Next I tried mixing Optimum protein powder with creatin in plain water. It tastes fantastic. No need to prepare an elaborate protein shake if you are running short of time. It tastes superb.  Especially the vanilla flavour goes with anything that you put it.",Reviewed in India on 16 September 2016,Flavour Name: VanillaSize: 1 Lbs,5
