"First of all I'm a big fan of Optimum Nutrition. I'm using their products since 2014.Attached screenshots are comparison of their old formula and new formula. You guys can see the difference.I had weight lifting gap be for few years due to my career. I recently started lifting again. I just bought this product and it gave me digestive issues the next day.Then I checked the formula and compared it with my old boxes and find out they have completely removed the digestive enzymes. It'll be difficult for lactose intolerant people.They have removed aminogen (patened enzyme) and lactase from their formula. Due to this many people could have digestive issues such as gas, bloating, gut irritability etc. especially for ibs people.Tip:- take it with banana and fiber you'll feel better.",Reviewed in India on 21 January 2023,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs
"The quality of Indian products doesn’t really match the quality of imported units. Imported ones taste 10 times better and mixes really well.They keep mentioning that they maintain high quality standards of manufacturing(which is true in case of the US, UK manufacture) but that’s not the case with the product manufactured in India.Yes, the units we receive now are manufactured in India by Tirupati Lifesciences. But the quality doesn’t seem to be as great as it was before.And we pay the same price for this as we did for imported units.ON should look into this quality issue for its international manufacturing.We pay a very good amount and we deserve best quality.",Reviewed in India on 28 January 2023,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs

"Product seems genuine. The only worry was the scoop is a transparent scoop with no logo on it. People who use Opitimum will be aware of the Golden scoop with Logo. I authenticated the product on Optimum website as well as had a call with the customer care- they told me due to environmental concerns the plastic  for the scoop is now transparent. Doesn't make sense at all? Taste wise is Ok.. flavours can be same as the actual rocky road, nor do other flavours except for the generic onces i.e vanilla, chocolate etc. Giving it 2 stars as of now, because of the scoop and the explanation given to me.",Reviewed in India on 14 July 2021,N/A
"I am taking  On's Gold standard since years.i can't say its grey market product but definately something wrong this time. Bright commodities said its genuine product when i sent scratch code but its mixability is really bad, not even mixing with shaker and taste is less chocolaty,i dnt feel any heavyness in stomach after having it. Noticed few changes in packaging. It clearly says FOR EXPORT ONLY and they are printing India's FSSAI green mark on label in USA. Feels like its substandard product. Manufacturing exclusively for people of India. I dnt know whats wrong but its definitely not On's Gold standard Whey that we had earlier. Discarding it and switching to Rule 1 or wild whey",Reviewed in India on 21 August 2018,N/A
"I recived ON GOLD STANDARD 2LB DOUBLE RICH CHOCOLATE on 19th November from cloudtail seller which is a near expiry product. When I call customer care for return pickup they recived my request but nobody came for pickup. I do the same procedure continuesly 5 day & on each day I receive a SMS that ur pickup has been canceled. The customer care has no control on Amazon logistic team or they both (seller, customer care, logistic) are clubbed with each other to harassing the customer. I request the each customer of Amazon please don't buy any Nutrition product from Amazon bcz if u receive any damage or near expiry product ur product will never pick for return, so beaware before buying Nutrition product from Amazon",Reviewed in India on 3 December 2019,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs

Gold standard whey is now no longer imported but now made in India. Instead of passing of benefit( no international shipping cost and no import custom duty) to the customer they increased the price further.Taste is also nothing great.

I used it for the first time and it smelled awesome I mean like pure chocolate but when I made a shake with water it tasted like water mixibility is bad it forms lumps I don't know if it contains any sugar or not but it tastes plane and when mixed with water it smells bad too. I checked the product on bright commodities and it showed that my product is authentic but I don't know I still have some issues. May be in India these products are not actually authentic.

I trusted clouldtail to buy supplements believing that i would get original products . It had bright commodities hologram and all which i found was persuasive enough to try it  .

We have been giving our son Whey Protien for the past 3 months. Last week my son was seriously ill with severe heart palpitation and breathlessness. The doctors attending to him in a major hospital said Whey protien may have produced this. We checked it out on the web and found this to be true. Please check under Whey Protien and Arthythmis and you will know what Iam talking about. It almost proved fatal to our son. We have taken him off it and he's much better.,Reviewed in India on 27 June 2015,Flavour Name: StrawberrySize: 2 Lbs
