I have received a fake product. There are worms in the protein powder. It looks like a lot of flour (atta) has been mixed in it. Tastes awful as well. I found out that there is a cut on the packaging. Someone smartly removed the whey and added flour (atta) with worms and put the label back. The cut was made deep down the jar so that the user does not notice it until he has consumed a lot of the product. Very disappointed. My diabetic father consumed it and had to visit the doctor twice due to severe digestive problems after consuming this. I don't know who to turn to for help.,Reviewed in India on 12 July 2024,Flavour Name: Alphonso MangoSize: 2 Lbs

Verified on is saying it's legit product but i am facing following problem :-1. No seal is present. Yes it is one of the top brand but no seal. They give code on the box but what will i do with the box if lid can easily be slided and some additional things can be added. Am supposed to eat box or the protein inside it? Even a cady is better wraped then this whey.2. Its is some what soluble but some of the part stays on the top when mixed with milk ( cold as well as hot milk ) didn't expect that from a world renowned brand like on and takes too much time to mix.3. It's September 2023 but i got product with mfg date june 2022 although it's not expired yet but why am I getting 1 yr late product.I will never buy anything from on ever again.,Reviewed in India on 18 September 2023,Flavour Name: Extreme Milk ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs

Package quality of instruction sticker very bad for India manuf double chocolate flavour, looks compromised for cost when compared to imported. I hope similarly the inner content of protein powder is not compromised. Difficult to say now. Compromise is evident on brand sticker which in itself is a proof that there may be compromise on quality for more profits, as the local manuf and plus is still same price, then why consumers to buy localised product with quality compromise. We may buy some other brand which is imported as In india the food quality checks cannot be trusted and stringent as USA quality. Very bad, now we can't trust the system authentication as the system authenticated product itself looks compromised. Manufactured in India was hidden by a sticker for some reason I don't know why. So it seems Optimum Nutrition wants just profits on his brand and any Tom Dick Harry will manuf in india.",Reviewed in India on 31 January 2022,Flavour Name: Double Rich ChocolateSize: 2 Lbs

I wonder what different procedure they did and it got authentication right as there are only 2 ways to do so ..I opened the jar and it had no seal in the inside to protect it from moisture ..I was not able to mix it well with the water ..The smell is something weird and also taste is something like a cough syrup nothing like a double chocolate..The consistency is too wattery after mixing.The 10 Days Return / Replacement is a total scam with this product , so don't believe what the tab below the product says! As you try to get it replaced or try to return it, they can only connect you to the Amazon customer care who in turn will ask  to mail and connect with the manufacturer.Overall not worth and a disappointment.

I've ordered and received this product by March 2021... I've consumed only 30% of this protein powder. I didn't notice the expiry date..

Then when I check the expiry date it was expired July 2021 and manufactured date was July 2019..

I don't understand why they have 3 bar codes and only one was read by the machine.The whey pounder has some white color material in it.The packing and the seal was not proper and it is safe to say that I was damaged.Not sure if Amazon is selling original ON products.

There is absolutely no seal, which is completely is contrast to what the website said. Product is readily available to rotate the cap anticlockwise and use. It's just like every other home container.2. The hologram is sticker on above the cap. Not in proper place.3. Container's bottom is not matching the description that's stated on official website.I've performed these tests only on packaging and container and it looks fake that way. However, I haven't used any sort of protein before so I'm clueless how to test the actual product.N.B.: I'm only doubting the genuineness of this product by looking at the packaging because it doesn't match the one described on the official website.
